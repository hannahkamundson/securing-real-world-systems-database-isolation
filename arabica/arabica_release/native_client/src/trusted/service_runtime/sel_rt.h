 * not have to bother saving them; %eax (or %edx:%eax pair) should
 * have the return value, so its old value is also not saved.  (We
 * should, however, ensure that there is not an accidental covert
 * channel leaking information via these registers on syscall return.)
 * The eflags register is also caller saved.
 *
 * TODO(bsy) if/when we do pre-emptive thread switching (to multiplex
 * user threads on top of kernel threads, for example), we will have
 * to add the full CPU state back in and figure out how to do a full
 * context switch completely in ring 3 code.
 *
 * We assume that the following is packed.  This is true for gcc and
 * msvc for x86, but we will include a check that sizeof(struct
 * NaClThreadContext) == 9*4 == 36 bytes.
